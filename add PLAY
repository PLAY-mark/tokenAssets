📑 Description
Token Name: PLAY
Project Website: https://myplay.network
✅ Checks
 I created a new folder with the token address (all in lowercase for EVM chains, case sensitive for Solana)
 I added the token's logo as a 32x32 PNG file, named logo-32.png
 I added the token's logo as a 128x128 PNG file, named logo-128.png
 I added the token's logo as a SVG file, named logo.svg
 My SVG logo is a proper SVG and does not contain base64 encoded elements
 My documentation/website clearly display the token address
